### Description (random babbling)
The game borrows a lot of gameplay ideas from [Hoplite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB_oG-_pYog), a simple little roguelike for mobile. I love the game, but I thought the gameplay and graphics could be improved. Ultimately I would love to have the game use 3d graphics. I also want the game to have a space theme similar to other games that have inspired this project ([FTL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/) and [Rymdkapsel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253790/rymdkapsel/) to name a few but alot of the core mechanics still mimic hoplite).
